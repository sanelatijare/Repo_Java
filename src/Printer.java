        * User can set toner level range between 0 to 100 (toner level cannot be greater than 100)
        * User should be able to see number of page printed
        * User should be able to print both sided (Note: in that case printed page should calculated correctly)
        * User can view current toner level at anytime
        * single page == single toner level; (Example: Toner = 100, printed page = 20, updated toner = 80)
        * If toner reaches < 1, then print "Low Toner, Please add more toner"
